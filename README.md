# Oceń Fryzjera
_english project name: Rate Barber_

## Project goals

The goal of the ***Oceń Fryzjera***'s project is to create internet website for booking visits in hairdressing salons. Furthermore, our service will have simple opinions feature to allow rating selected salons and barbers.

The hairdressing salons available via our website will be checked for reliability to ensure transactions security for users, who would like to use our solution. 

Our service will also offer:
- wide range of services
- comparing prices of services between available hairdressing salons
- choosing the best visit's date
- notifications for upcoming visits
- getting contact information

First visit booked via our service will require user to pay in advance, which will help to avoid booking fake visits.
It will also increase security and gain trust from new salons beginning using our solution.

## The purpose of project realization

Our motivation is to create a place in the internet, which would help to improve a process of booking hairdressing visits. Most of people today simply don't like to waste time booking them by phone.

The goal of our service is to change it. Furthermore, our mission is to help smaller or new salons with advertising their offers and reach more and more potential clients.
Our solution will help all the salons to save their time, because all booked visits will be available in one place, convenient to manage.

An additional advantage of our service, really important for salons interested in collaboration, is required payment in advance from new website users - it's our time and money saver, because it's unlikely, that a client will pay for a service and wouldn't come for it.
